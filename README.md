# React Native Navigation - Stack

- change About `navigate` to `push`
- Now multiple about screens stack up
- Add a Back button to About to `goBack`
- wrap Buttons in a View - style=button
- Note the "back" Android button behaves as expected here
- Add "Goto Top" Button (popToTop)
- add another Button to try `pop(n)`
