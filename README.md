# React Native Navigation - Stack

- Can pass params to screens as a 2nd param to `navigate` & `push`
- end up in props
- Note: Not for passing functions or objects. Just ID's etc
- can also use headerTitle function. Returns jsx (overrides title)
- note: headerTitleStyle​ only works with `title` option
- can also replace the entire header with `header​` option (gets )
- To set a custom header for all the screens in the navigator, you can specify this option in the screenOptions prop of the navigator.
